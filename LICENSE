According to the Paradox Development Studios' "User Modding
Rules of PDS Games" I cannot license this code to you (point
4).

> The User Mod may not include ANY kind of license or claim of

section).

That means that all code written by me is protected by my
personal, automatic copyright (per US law).

Based on my understanding of US copyright law:

> **When is my work protected?**
> Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is
> created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible
> either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.

and the PDS modding guidelines (point 5):

> The User Mod should respect the work of other modders and not
> include any work without the consent of that modder.

You may not reuse the portions of this codebase created by me
(Nicholas Butcher) in other mods without my express permission.
